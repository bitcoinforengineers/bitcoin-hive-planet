# 🐝 The Bitcoin Hive Planet

**A cinematic, real-time 3D blockchain explorer** — visualizing every block in Bitcoin's history as a hive on a glowing planet in cyberspace.

> Inspired by Michael Saylor’s metaphor of “a swarm of cyber hornets,” this project transforms Bitcoin’s blockchain into a navigable digital world. You can fly across time, see transactions as beams of light, and explore the economic architecture of proof-of-work.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🌍 Key Features

- 🧱 **Blocks as Buildings**  
  Each block is a 3D hive node on a planetary grid. Larger rewards = larger hives.

- ⚡ **Real-Time Mining**  
  Pending blocks pulse with energy. When a new block is mined, it solidifies on the surface.

- 🐝 **Miner Swarm**  
  Active miners are visualized as animated cyber hornets orbiting the core.

- 🌐 **Transaction Beams**  
  Incoming mempool transactions are represented as electric beams flying into the pending block.

- 🧠 **Protocol Core (The Goddess of Wisdom)**  
  At the center of the planet is a glowing AI orb representing the incorruptible Bitcoin protocol.

- 🕹️ **Fully Explorable 3D Space**  
  Free-fly camera navigation (mouse + WASD) with cinematic bloom and ambient lighting.

- 📊 **Live HUD Overlay**  
  Display of current block height, hashrate, and mempool activity.

## 🧭 Visual Language

| Block Status | Visual Cue | Color |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Mined      | Solid Hive Building | Rich Orange `#ff8c00` |
| ⚡ Pending    | Glowing, Pulsing Box | Bright Yellow `#ffff00` |
| 🔲 Future     | Wireframe Scaffold | Dark Gray `#505050` |

Block size is determined by the block reward, creating continents of early (50 BTC) blocks and smaller islands in modern (3.125 BTC) eras — forming a *topographical history of halvings*.
